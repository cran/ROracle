   NOTE: Next version will probably comply with the emerging common
         database interface being drafted by the R-SIG-DB.  This will
         probably change slightly the function names, but not the
         basic functionality.

Version 0.3.1

* Ported to R, added a configure script.  

* Implemented a work­around to the very nasty bug in the linux
  implementation of the ProC/C++ (as of 8.1.[567]) (see the function
  filter_buggy_error() in RS-Oracle.pc) The sign was that Oracle
  would give a "fetch out of order" error when there was no fetching
  going on.

* Modified the documentation to pass R CMD check. Unfortunately we now
  have two slightly separate versions of the help (one for Splus, another
  for R).

Splus-specific

* It nows does the  #include "S.h" conditionally, for the sake of 
  Splus 6.0 (you need to define the macro SPLUS6 in the makefile).
