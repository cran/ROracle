For details on how to compile ROracle under windows see the file
src/Makefile.win -- it pretty much documents requirements, etc.

To run the Windows binary packge ROracle_<version>.zip
you'll need the client software from Oracle.  You must have the
$ORACLE_HOME/bin in your path in order for R to find the Oracle's
runtime libraries.
