* The RS-DBI needs to be finalized.  Once the R-SIG-DB agrees on
  a final API implement it.

* Implement the "bind variables" idea -- useful for writing into
  databases, but not too critical(?) for select operations.
 
* Implement the "host arrays" feature that allows us to fetch
  multiple records per EXEC SQL FETCH.  This may give us
  a "markedly" performance (Ch 12, ProC/C++ manual).
 
* Security. Need to implement a better authentication mechanism,
  possibly similar to the MySQL or the ODBC?
 
* Performance. We haven't done anything on this yet.

* Long term. Should we reimplement the guts using OCI instead of the ProC/C++?
