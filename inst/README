R/S Database Interface to Oracle. 

This library implements an R/S-Oracle interface according to the
R/S-Database Interface specification 0.2 (see www.omegahat.org or
the RS-DBI.pdf document in the "doc" directory)

This driver is based on the Oracle embedded proC/C++, and is
somewhat(?) compliant with the SQL92 as defined by the X/Open
Specification 1992, 1994 (see ISBN: 1-872630-58-8). Another
alternative is to implement this same driver using the Oracle's
OCI API.  We decided to use the embedded dynamic SQL hoping that it
would be very easy to port to Informix, Sybase, DB2, Ingres, etc.
We'll see if this is the case.

Example:
-------

help(Oracle)

ora <- dbManager("Oracle")  
con <- dbConnect(ora, user = "opto", password = oraPass, dbname = "ORAS")
rs <- dbExecStatement(con, "select * from USER_TABLES")
rel <- fetch(rs, n = 10)

# create a concurrent second connection

fms <- dbConnect(ora, user = "fraud", password = fms.pass, dbname = "FMS)
quickSQL(fms, "select SCORE from HOT_SCORED_EVENTS")

pix <- dbConnect(ora, user = "genuse", password = pix.pass, dbname = "ALPIX")
quickSQL(pix, "select * from WAFER_PRO where LOT_ID = 12345")

# creata a list with all the currently open connections

getConnections(ora)

close(pix)
