The ROracle was tested with R 1.3.1 and with Oracle 8.0.4 Enterprise
as a server on a Solaris system. Also, it was tested  on a Linux
8.1.7 client-only installation.  (A previous version was successfully
run with Oracle 7).

Oracle Requirements:
--------------------

  For compiling, the R-Oracle interface needs the client part of
  the Oracle distribution (in particular the "programmer" and
  "application user" packages), you don't need the Oracle server.

  Make sure you have the Oracle ProC/C++ properly configure (e.g.,
  $ORACLE_HOME/proc/admin/pcscfg.cfg in Oracle8), otherwise you
  will run into problems either during pre-compilation and/or linking.

Using library(ROracle):
-----------------------

  If you see an error like the one below when you issue the
  library(ROracle) command, you may need to define or update you
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  For instance,

  > library(ROracle)
  Error in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) : 
     unable to load shared library "/usr/dj/linux/R/ROracle/libs/ROracle.so":
  /usr/dj/linux/R/ROracle/libs/ROracle.so: undefined symbol: sqlclu
  Error in library(ROracle) : .First.lib failed
 
  Solution 1:  Update $LD_LIBRARY_PATH *before* invoking R, e.g.,

  $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  $ R
  > library(ROracle)
  >
  
  Solution 2: Create a static library (see below).
 
Installation:
-------------

Shell variables:

  1. ORACLE_HOME should be set and exported (sh/bash/ksh) 

  2. PATH must include the path to Oracle's pre-compiler "proc", e.g.,
     PATH=$PATH:$ORACLE_HOME/bin

Simple Installation (should work for Oracle8 and Oracle9):

  R CMD [options] ROracle_<version>.tar.gz

Creating a static library:

  You may statically link ROracle to the Oracle libs (this creates
  a much bigger executable file) with

  R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--enable-static'  ROracle_<version>.tar.gz

Specifying the Oracle versions (7/8/9, version 8 is the default):

  R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--with-oracle=7'  ROracle_<version>.tar.gz

Note: You may override the Oracle libraries and/or library directories 
using the PKG_LIBS variable (see "Writing R Extensions").
