1. Introduction
===============

  ROracle has been built and tested with R versions 2.12 through 2.15 and with
  Oracle Instant Client and Oracle Database Client versions 10.2 through 11.2
  on both 32 and 64-bit running Linux and Windows operating systems.

2. Requirements
===============

  Linux
  -----

  For compiling on Linux, ROracle needs either the Oracle Instant Client or
  the Oracle Database Client part of the Oracle Database distribution
  (ORACLE_HOME based client). If using an Instant Client you will need
  either the Basic or Basic Lite packages in addition to the SDK package. You
  can use either the RPM or ZIP package. You can simplify the ROracle
  installation process by using Instant Client RPM packages.

  NOTE: Basic Lite, is geared toward applications that require English-only
    error messages and use either US7ASCII, WE8DEC, or a Unicode characterset.
    It also has no restrictions on the TERRITORY field of the NLS_LANG setting.
    As a result, applications that meet these characterset and territory
    criteria can significantly reduce its footprint if they use the Basic Lite
    package.

  Windows
  -------

  For compiling on Windows, ROracle needs either an Oracle Instant Client or
  Oracle Database Client. If using Oracle Instant Client, you will need either
  a Basic or Basic Lite package in addition to the SDK package of Instant
  Client. If not using Oracle Instant Client, you will only need the Oracle
  Database Client part of the Oracle Database distribution (ORACLE_HOME based
  client). When building on 64-bit platform, you can build both the 32-bit and
  64-bit packages. If you need both, you will need to install both 32 and
  64-bit versions of Instant Client or Oracle Database Client. 

  NOTE: Basic Lite, is geared toward applications that require English-only
    error messages and use either US7ASCII, WE8DEC, or a Unicode characterset.
    It also has no restrictions on the TERRITORY field of the NLS_LANG setting.
    As a result, applications that meet these characterset and territory
    criteria can significantly reduce its footprint if they use the Basic Lite
    package.

  TimesTen
  --------
  
  For TimesTen connection support, ROracle should be compiled using the Oracle
  Instant Client included in the local TimesTen installation directory. For 
  more information on TimesTen see http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/
  timesten/documentation/.

  Instant Client
  --------------

  For more information on Oracle Instant Client see http://www.oracle.com/
  technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index-100365.html.

3. Installation
===============

  Linux - Instant Client
  ----------------------

  The ROracle build depends on Oracle Client libraries and header files. To
  build with 11.2 client version, you can get Instant Client 11.2 from an RPM.
  It has both the Basic and the SDK packages. It places the files in standard
  locations that ROracle configure script can find. For example, on a 32-bit
  system, Oracle Instant Client will be installed in 
  /usr/lib/oracle/11.2/client/lib. On a 64-bit system, it is installed in
  /usr/lib/oracle/11.2/client64/lib. After installing the Oracle Instant
  Client, change LD_LIBRARY_PATH as follows:

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/oracle/11.2/client64/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  R CMD INSTALL ROracle_1.1-12.tar.gz
 
  Alternatively, you can extract Oracle Instant Client from a zip package. In
  this case, a symbolic link libclntsh.so needs to be created manually before
  proceeding to install ROracle.

  cd <to the directory where Oracle Instant Client is installed>
  ln -s libclntsh.so.11.1 libclntsh.so
  Then, set LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Additionally, specify the location of Oracle
  Client libraries and header files via either an environment variable
  OCI_LIB or a configure option --with-oci-lib. 
 
  For example, if Oracle Instant Client was installed in
  /scratch/instantclient_11_2, then you need to do the following::
  
  export OCI_LIB=/scratch/instantclient_11_2
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/scratch/instantclient_11_2:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  R CMD INSTALL ROracle_1.1-12.tar.gz

  Alternatively, if using the --with-oci-lib configure option, you can do the
  following:

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/scratch/instantclient_11_2:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--with-oci-lib=/scratch/instantclient_11_2' ROracle_1.1-12.tar.gz

  Both methods assume that Basic and SDK packages were unzipped into the same
  directory and Oracle Client headers are located under $OCI_LIB/sdk/include. 
  If this is not the case, then set either the OCI_INC environment variable or
  the --with-oci-inc configure option appropriately..

  Linux - Oracle Client (Oracle home installation)
  ------------------------------------------------

  As in the previous section, set LD_LIBRARY_PATH  to include the path to
  Oracle Client libraries. Additionally, set ORACLE_HOME. Then install the
  ROracle package by running

  R CMD INSTALL ROracle_1.1-12.tar.gz


  Windows
  -------

  For compiling on Windows, ROracle needs either the Oracle Instant Client or
  only the Oracle Database Client part of the Oracle Database distribution
  (ORACLE_HOME based client).
  When using Oracle Instant Client you will need either the Basic or Basic Lite
  package in addition to the SDK package. Once ROracle is built with any
  supported version of Oracle Client, at run-time one can use an appropriate
  supported version of Oracle Instant Client or Oracle home
  based Client without requiring a re-build of ROracle.

  Once ROracle is built and installed, 64-bit version of R will use the 64-bit
  version of Oracle Client and the 32-bit version of R will use the 32-bit
  version of Oracle Client. If there are multiple versions of Oracle Client in
  the path, first one in the path that corresponds to R architecture will be
  loaded by ROracle.
  For example, if the path has
  c:\temp\i386\instantclient_10_2;c:\temp\x64\instantclient_11_1;c:\temp\i386\instantclient_11_2;c:\temp\x64\instantclient_11_2;%PATH%
  then R 32-bit will use instantclient_10_2 and R 64-bit will use
  instantclient_11_1, rest will be ignored. The version that is required must
  be in the PATH first, it is recommended to have only one version for each
  architecture in the PATH. Refer to item 8 of Troubleshooting section to
  determine the architecture of Oracle Client being used.

  For process interoperability on Windows, refer to
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa384231%28v=vs.85%29.aspx

  Windows - Instant Client
  ------------------------

  When building both the 32-bit and 64-bit of ROracle on a 64-bit platform both
  32-bit and 64-bit Instant Client Basic or Basic Lite and SDK packages should
  be downloaded and unzipped into separate locations. The example below assumes
  11.2 Instant Client. For example, let us assume that the 32-bit packages will
  be unzipped into c:/instantclient/i386 and 64-bit into c:/instantclient/x64
  using Oracle Instant Client. As a result oci.dll library will be located at
  c:/instantclient/i386/instantclient_11_2 and
  c:/instantclient/x64/instantclient_11_2 respectively. The header files will
  be at c:/instantclient/i386/instantclient_11_2/sdk/include and
  c:/instantclient/x64/instantclient_11_2/sdk/include (you can use either set
  of header files for both 32-bit and 64-bit builds).

  To build on a 32-bit platform only the 32-bit Oracle Instant Client package
  is needed. To build only 64-bit R on a 64-bit platform, only the 64-bit
  Oracle Instant Client package is needed.

  Set the OCI_LIB32 and OCI_LIB64 environment variables as described below.
  OCI_LIB32 should specify
  the location of 32-bit libraries and OCI_LIB64 the location of 64-bit
  libraries. If header files are not located in the sdk/include subdirectory of
  the Instant Client directory (the directory that contains the libraries),
  then set the OCI_INC environment variable to locate the header files.

  Additionally on a 64-bit platform, set the PATH environment variable
  appropriately. On a 64-bit platform, add
  c:\instantclient\x64\instantclient_11_2 to the PATH environment variable. On
  a 32-bit platform, add c:\instantclient\i386\instantclient_11_2 to the PATH
  environment variable. This should be added to the system variables path.
  Setting the environment variable is Windows operating system specific. On
  Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, it can be set using "System" in the
  control panel or the properties of "My Computer" (under the "Advanced" tab).
  In Windows Vista, 7 or Server 2008, go to "User Accounts" in the Control
  Panel, and select your account and then "Change my environment variables".
  Restart the command window after making this change. 

  To build both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of ROracle, add both the 32-bit and
  64-bit versions of instant client to the PATH environment variable step. Once
  ROracle is built and installed, 64-bit version of R will use the 64-bit
  version of Oracle Instant Client and 32-bit of R the 32-bit version of Oracle
  Instant Client.

  To build with --merge-multiarch

  set OCI_LIB32=c:/instantclient/i386/instantclient_11_2
  set OCI_LIB64=c:/instantclient/x64/instantclient_11_2
  set PATH=c:\instantclient\i386\instantclient_11_2;c:\instantclient\x64\instantclient_11_2;%PATH%
  R CMD INSTALL --build --merge-multiarch ROracle_1.1-12.tar.gz

  To build only 32-bit version

  set OCI_LIB32=c:/instantclient/i386/instantclient_11_2
  set PATH=c:\instantclient\i386\instantclient_11_2;%PATH%
  R CMD INSTALL --build ROracle_1.1-12.tar.gz

  To build only the 64-bit version

  set OCI_LIB64=c:/instantclient/x64/instantclient_11_2
  set PATH=c:\instantclient\x64\instantclient_11_2;%PATH%
  R CMD INSTALL --build ROracle_1.1-12.tar.gz

  To set OCI_INC

  set OCI_INC=c:/instantclient/x64/instantclient_11_2/sdk/include

  Windows - Oracle Client (Oracle home based client)
  --------------------------------------------------

  As in the previous section PATH should be set to include the path to Oracle
  Client libraries. Oracle Universal Installer should have set the PATH and
  ORACLE_HOME in the registry database.

  Set OCI_LIB32 or OCI_LIB64 depending on your current platform architecture
  for Windows.

  For example, if user "xyz" has installed the Oracle Client version 11.2 using
  the default location in the Oracle Universal Installer on 64-bit Windows,
  set OCI_INC and OCI_LIB64 as follows:

  set OCI_INC=C:/app/xyz/product/11.2.0/client_1/oci/include
  set OCI_LIB64=C:/app/xyz/product/11.2.0/client_1/bin

  Build the ROracle package using:

  R CMD INSTALL ROracle_1.1-12.tar.gz

  To build both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of ROracle, add both the 32-bit and
  64-bit versions of Oracle Client to the path environment variable before
  building ROracle. Once ROracle is built and installed, 64-bit version of R
  will use the 64-bit version of Oracle Client and 32-bit the 32-bit version of
  Oracle Client.

  To build both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Roracle:

  set OCI_INC=C:/app/xyz/product/11.2.0/32_bit_client_1/oci/include
  set OCI_LIB32=C:/app/xyz/product/11.2.0/32_bit_client_1/bin
  set OCI_LIB64=C:/app/xyz/product/11.2.0/64_bit_client_1/bin
  R CMD INSTALL --build --merge-multiarch ROracle_1.1-12.tar.gz

  When mixing Oracle Instant Client and Oracle home-based Client, above
  environment variables must be set carefully to point to the specific Client
  installation. It is recommended to have only one version of the client to
  simplify administration.


  TimesTen
  --------
  
  When building ROracle for TimesTen connection support on Windows or Linux the 
  Instant Client included in the local TimesTen installation directory should 
  be used. For example, if TimesTen 64-bit is installed on Windows in the 
  c:/TimesTen/tt1122_64 directory: then issue the following commands:
  
  set OCI_LIB64=c:/TimesTen/tt1122_64/ttoracle_home/instantclient_11_2
  R CMD INSTALL --build ROracle_1.1-12.tar.gz
  
  At runtime the directories for both the TimesTen Instant Client shared 
  libraries and the TimesTen database shared libraries must be present on the
  system's shared library search path (PATH on Windows or LD_LIBRARY_PATH on 
  Linux) in order to establish a TimesTen database connection. An easy way to 
  do this is to run the ttenv script located in the bin directory of the local 
  TimesTen installation directory.
  
  For example, if TimesTen 64-bit is installed on Windows in the 
  c:/TimesTen/tt1122_64 directory: issue the following command
  to set the system's shared library search path for TimesTen connections
  
  c:/TimesTen/tt1122_64/bin/ttenv.bat
  
  For more information on TimesTen see http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/
  database/timesten/documentation/.
 

4. Troubleshooting:
-------------------

  Linux
  -----

  If you see an error about opening an Oracle Client library libclntsh.so
  when issuing the library(ROracle) command, you probably did not add the path
  to Oracle Client libraries to LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

  > library(ROracle)
  Loading required package: DBI
  Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) : 
   unable to load shared object '.../library/ROracle/libs/ROracle.so':
  libclntsh.so.11.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  Error: package/namespace load failed for 'ROracle'
 
  See the Installation section above for details on setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

  Windows
  -------

1. If you see following error during build of ROracle, then the oci.dll
   loaded from PATH by R does not correspond to the same architecture as R.

    ** testing if installed package can be loaded
    Error in inDL(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now), ...) :
      unable to load shared object '.../library/ROracle/libs/i386/ROracle.dll':
        LoadLibrary failure:  %1 is not a valid Win32 application.

   To resolve this, set the PATH to include the 32-bit version of Oracle Client
   when 32-bit version of R is used and 64-bit version of Oracle Client when
   64-bit version of R is used. One cannot build 64-bit version of ROracle
   using 32-bit version of R and vice versa.

2. One may also see the error message 
   ".../i686-w64-mingw32/bin/ld.exe: i386:x86-64 architecture of input file
     `.../oci.dll' is incompatible with i386 output"
   when installing 32-bit version of ROracle with a 64-bit version of
   oci.dll. This error is followed by undefined references to OCI functions
   as shown below:

    rooci.o:rooci.c:(.text+0x9d): undefined reference to `OCIDescriptorAlloc'
    rooci.o:rooci.c:(.text+0x17e): undefined reference to `OCIDateTimeFromText'
    ...
    rooci.o:rooci.c:(.text+0x22a4): undefined reference to `OCIDateTimeConvert'
    collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
    ERROR: compilation failed for package 'ROracle'
 
   Above errors may also be seen when oci.dll is missing in the directory
   specified by the OCI_LIB32 or OCI_LIB64 environment variables.

3. When following error is displayed during installation of ROracle, it is due
   to oci.dll not being compatible with the R architecture.
     collect2: ld returned 5 exit status
     ERROR: compilation failed for package 'ROracle'

   Solution: specify OCI_LIB32 to point to 32-bit version of client and
                     OCI_LIB64 to point to 64-bit version of client

4. If you see dialogue box with the title "Rterm.exe - System Error" with the
   the message "OCI.dll missing from your system, try installing it"
   followed by error below when issuing the library(ROracle) command or during
   install, then Oracle Client libraries were not found in the PATH environment
   variable.

    Error in inDL(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now), ...) :
      unable to load shared object '.../library/ROracle/libs/.../ROracle.dll':
      LoadLibrary failure:  The specified module could not be found.

5. If you see an error about oci.dll not found, then either the OCI_LIB32 or
   OCI_LIB64 points to a location that does not have the Oracle Client
   installed.

     gcc.exe: error: .../oci.dll: No such file or directory
     ERROR: compilation failed for package 'ROracle'

6. If you see one of the following error messages when building ROracle it is
   due to oci.dll not compatible with the R architecture. One of the messages
   below will be displayed with 11.X or higher version of Oracle Instant Client
   or home based client instead of the messages listed in 1,2 or 3 above.

    Client Shared Library 32-bit - ... cannot be used to install with 64-bit R.
    Client Shared Library 64-bit - ... cannot be used to install with 32-bit R.

7. If you see following error when loading ROracle library, then the oci.dll
   loaded from PATH by R does not correspond to the same architecture as R.

   > library(ROracle)
   Loading required package: DBI
   Error in inDL(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now), ...) :
     unable to load shared object '.../library/ROracle/libs/.../ROracle.dll':
     LoadLibrary failure:  %1 is not a valid Win32 application.

   Error: package/namespace load failed for 'ROracle'

   To resolve this, set the PATH to include the 32-bit version of Oracle Client
   when 32-bit version of R is used and 64-bit version of Oracle Client when
   64-bit version of R is used. One cannot build or run 64-bit version of
   ROracle using 32-bit version of R and vice versa.

8. Determining the architecture of Oracle Client:

   Oracle Instant Client provide BASIC_README and BASIC_LITE_README files
   showing the architecture they were built on.

   For Oracle home based Client, check the registry. A 32-bit home will be
   located in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE->Software->WOW6432Node->Oracle, and a 64-bit
   home will be in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE->Software->Oracle, then check the path to
   the home to try to infer whether it is 32-bit or 64-bit based on the
   location of dlls.

   If you have both 32-bit and 64-bit clients installed in the PATH, we depend
   on the OS to load 32-bit dlls for 32-bit R process and 64-bit for 64-bit R
   process.
